# JIT - Just In Time Version Control System
### JIT is a simple version control system inspired by Git. It allows users to track changes to files and manage project history.

### It is a project that i have created step-by-step with this amazing book called "Building Git" by James Coglan.
#### For now I have finished the project until chapter-4

## Features
Basic Operations: JIT supports basic version control operations such as init, add, commit, checkout, and log.
Object Storage: JIT stores project data as blobs, trees, and commits.
History Tracking: JIT tracks project history (for now it is only on one branch)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites:
Python 3.x

### Installation
Clone the JIT repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jit.git
cd jit
```
## Usage
Initialize a new JIT repository:
```bash
python jit.py init
```

Commit changes:
```bash
python jit.py commit -m "Commit message"
```
