Initial revision of "jit", this is th project i am building with the building-git book
This commit records a minimal set of functionality necessary for the
code to store itself as a valid Git commit. This includes writing the
following object types to the database:
- Blobs of ASCII text
- Trees containing a flat list of regular files
- Commits that contain a tree pointer, author info and message
These objects are written to `.git/objects`, compressed using zlib.
At this stage, there is no index and no `add` command; the `commit`
command simply writes everything in the working tree to the database and
commits it.
